# Keepalive-Daemon sysext

The Keepalived sysext ships a statically compiled keepalived.

# Usage

Download and merge the sysext at provisioning time using the below butane snippet.

The snippet includes automated updates via systemd-sysupdate.
Sysupdate will stage updates and request a reboot by creating a flag file at `/run/reboot-required`.
You can deactivate updates by changing `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` in `systemd-sysupdate.timer`.

Note that the snippet is for the x86-64 version of keepalived v2.3.1.
